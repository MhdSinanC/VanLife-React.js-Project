## About the Project
VanLife is a React SPA built while learning advanced React concepts.

### What I learned
- React Router (nested routes)
- Data fetching and error handling
- Component composition
- State vs derived state
- Project structuring

### Notes
- Authentication is mocked
- Backend is simulated using a local server
